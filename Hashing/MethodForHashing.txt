there are mainly three methods for hashing and maping
1. Division method (linear chaining)
2. Folding method
3. Mod square method
here is the explanation of Division method
ex: [2,5,16,28,139]
and almax you can make a array of size 10 i.e. 0-9 
what ever number we have we will try to arr[i]%10
this also cause collision or having collision factor
ex: in our array we have 28,8,38 and 28
first we have sorted 28%10 is 8 so at place of 8 we have sorted 28 then 
comes the 8 where we will sorte it then linear chaining comes to play
8->28 ->8->38
    \
     -> 28 we are chaining it
