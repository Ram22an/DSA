Suppose we call doctor and teacher
Example Dr. X and Y sir/Madam
Dr. and Sir/madam are noun and there name are proper noun 
same as that dr. and sir/madam are class and their name are object
Here are the component of class and objects
in python atributes are both member function and variables
###############################################
1. Constructor/Destructor
2. Access Specifier(private, public, proected)
3. Encapsulation(it is the bundling of variables and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.)
4. Abstraction(it is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.)
5. Inheritance(it is a mechanism where a new class (derived class) inherits the properties and behavior (methods) of an existing class (base class).)
6. Polymorphism(it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way, to identical messages (or methods). Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).)

in python there are two types of object class object and instance object
class TestClass:
    VAr1=5
    def ShowFunction():
        print("Hello")
Obj=TestClass() # this is a instance object
if we write TestClass() this will call a function which will return reference to this object
if we write TestClass this is a class object and there could be only one class object only 
the name of the class refernce to the class and it is also called as class object
we don't have to create class object because when we create a class class object is created 
and object inside the class are class object not the instance object 
to create instance object we will use def __init__(self):
it is a Constructor
Obj=TestClass() # this is a instance object
and this also mean __init__(Obj)
###############################################
there are 3 types of methods (function)
1. instance method
2. static method
3. class method

this is a instance method
def f1(self):
    pass

# this is a static method
@staticmethod
def F2():
    pass

# this is a class method 
@classmethod
def F3(cls):
    pass
